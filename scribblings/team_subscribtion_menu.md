Select menu for each team active in the league, if there is more then 25 replace 25th option with "More Teams", loops round rather then page select because i Highly Doubt there will ever be more then 48 teams in one league and even if there is you need 96 for 4 pages to be full (when pagnating, max 24 on a page due to needing the space for the button)


Game end
- when a game ends, fetch the days schedule and check if all games have ended
